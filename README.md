# O4DS

Academic project about the minimization of a MSE + L1 loss function through the implementation of the algorithms Heavy Ball Method and Proximal Bundle Method made from scratch.

Contents of the repository:

- Neural network implementation: `NN_implementation`
- Heavy Ball algorithm implementation: `HB_implementation`
- Proximal Bundle Method algorithm implementation: `PBM_implementation`
- Random search on Iris dataset: `Random search Iris` (imported from library)
- Random search on Wine dataset: `Random search Wine` (imported from library)

Each script includes implementations for both a network with 1 hidden layer and a network with 2 hidden layers.

The random search scripts contain examples with the neural network having 1 hidden layer: to test the 2-layer version, simply add the suffix `_2l` to the function calls.
